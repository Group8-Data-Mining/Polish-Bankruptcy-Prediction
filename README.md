# Problem

Our project focuses on classifying bankrupt companies using financial and operational data from Polish companies. We have refined our problem by emphasizing the evaluation of classification models and feature selection techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. The primary goal remains predicting bankruptcy, a crucial factor for lenders, investors, and stakeholders to mitigate financial risk. By analyzing financial performance, liquidity ratios, and other key indicators, we aim to develop a predictive model that aids in risk assessment and financial decision-making.

Bankruptcy prediction is formulated as a classification problem in data mining, where the task is to categorize companies as either bankrupt or non-bankrupt based on historical financial data. We will apply various classification techniques, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees,  and ensemble methods, to determine the most effective model. Additionally, feature selection techniques will be explored to reduce redundancy in financial indicators derived from balance sheets and income statements.

Bankruptcy can have widespread economic consequences, affecting employment, supply chains, and investor confidence. Developing a reliable predictive model can provide financial institutions the tools to mitigate risks associated with failing companies. Moreover, early identification of financial distress can allow businesses to take corrective measures before reaching insolvency.

# Data Resources

We have acquired the dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains bankruptcy information for Polish companies across multiple years and consists of 65 financial features and 10,503 observations. The dataset includes indicators such as sales, profits, inventories, assets, and liabilities, making it well-suited for our classification task.
